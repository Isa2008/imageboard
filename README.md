This site is a plain Instagram-inspired image-board to upload pictures and write comments with usernames. I named it "Why do we communicate?", to show that inner feelings can be expressed by photos and visually communicated. We are communicating all time by using such apps as Instagram.

# Tech Stack

It's a single-page framework application made with:

* HTML, CSS/RWD, Javascript, Vue.js, Node.js, Express, AWS/S3, Multer, PostgreSQL

       Including a database with two tables:
              - Upload image with title, description, username
              - Post comment with username

The project was made in one week during my training at SPICED Academy Berlin. They provided me with a package.json.
