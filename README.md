# Image-board

![Alt Text](demo-pics-gifs/image-board.png)

This site is a plain Instagram-inspired image-board to upload pictures and write comments with a username. I named it "Why do we communicate?", to show that inner feelings can be expressed by photos and visually communicated. We are communicating all time by using such apps as Instagram.

# Tech Stack

It's a single-page framework application made with:

* HTML, CSS/RWD, Javascript, Vue.js, Node.js, Express, AWS/S3, Multer, PostgreSQL

       Including a database with two tables:
              - Uploading images with title, description and username
              - Posting comments with username

The project was made in one week during my training at SPICED Academy Berlin. They provided me with a package.json.

Images taken from Instagram accounts such as Cottweiler, Fashion For Bank Robbers, Craig Green, Kikokostadinov, Ren Hang, Walter Van Beirendonck, combined with images of a photo series that I made in collaboration with the photographer Eva Baramsky.

## Mobile responsive

Images drop in a vertical line in responsive version.
