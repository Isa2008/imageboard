# Image-board

This site is a plain Instagram-inspired image-board to upload pictures and post comments by users. I named it "Why do we communicate?", to show that inner feelings can be expressed by photos. With these pictures mostly from fashion designers and photographers on the edge, I'd also like to say, dress the way you feel.

It's a single-page application made with:

* HTML
* CSS / Mobile responsive
* Vue.js
* Node.js
* Express
* AWS S3
* Multer
* PostgreSQL:

       Including a database with two tables:
              - Uploading images with title, description and username
              - Posting comments with username

The project was made in one week during my training at SPICED Academy Berlin.

Images taken from Instagram accounts such as Cottweiler, Fashion For Bank Robbers, Craig Green, Kikokostadinov, Ren Hang, Walter Van Beirendonck, combined with images of a photo series that I made in collaboration with the photographer Eva Baramsky.
